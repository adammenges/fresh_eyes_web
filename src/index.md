# Aim

This cluster brings recent developments in machine learning (ML) to bear on generative architectural design. To improve the utility of artificial intelligence as a creative partner for design, we have brought together experts from architectural design practice, ML engineering, and design methods research, and have developed methods for the incorporation of user-generated image-based ML recognition models into the evaluation step of a traditional generative design workflow. While existing research ((For a survey of [existing ML-related plugins](link.html "a title") for Grasshopper, see the relevant Appendix below.)) has integrated low-level ML operations into the parametric design environment with a level of success, this proposal uniquely links the familiar environment of Grasshopper with cloud-hosted models trained using the high-level and relatively user-friendly Tensorflow framework. Over the course of this workshop, participants will train purpose-built image-based models to evaluate candidate design solutions based on a variety of tacit and heretofore un-encapsulatable design criteria of their choosing, such as architectural style, spatial experience, or typological features. Participants will then deploy these models to the cloud, and integrate them into functional generative design systems via API calls.

The integration of an ML evaluation step into a generative design workflow opens up a range of possible design scenarios. While the definition of specific studies will be left to the discretion of workshop participants, a number of potential studies are listed here. This abbreviated list was compiled both to illustrate the new opportunities brought about by ML, and to demonstrate the breadth of potential applications implied by our approach to the subject.
